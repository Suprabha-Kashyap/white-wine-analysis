# white-wine-analysis
The white wine analysis dataset contains various physicochemical properties of white wines, along with a quality rating. Description of the columns found in such a dataset:

Input variables:                    
1 - fixed acidity                          
2 - volatile acidity                       
3 - citric acid                           
4 - residual sugar                     
5 - chlorides                             
6 - free sulfur dioxide                           
7 - total sulfur dioxide                         
8 - density                           
9 - pH                                     
10 - sulphates                                   
11 - alcohol                                         

Output variable:
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)                              

These attributes are used to perform data analysis, aiming to understand the relationship between these chemical properties and the quality of the wine.
